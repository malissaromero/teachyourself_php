1. I chose PHP because, I've seen it as an essential requirement for jobs and have not looked into it yet.

2. It is a server side language and can be used to make fast and easy prototyping.

3. It is similar to erb files where you can embed the code into the HTML.

4. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page because it was created by a man that wanted to use PHP on his personal home page in 1995. He never intended to create a programming language. It was so easy to understand that many programmers began to add to the language and is now a server side language that stands for PHP hypertext pre-processor.

5. I wasn't able to build something on it. I just played around with functions and variables. I thought it was very easy to understand and it helps making hard concepts a little washed down.

6. I wasn't able to get into manipulating the server requests, so I still want to go back and learn more about that.

7. I first did the PHP Basics Course in Tree house that were great in breaking down PHP but it got a little slow when they were explaining datatypes so I moved on to Robin's screencast and notes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O11hPhF5GAA&feature=youtu.be
It was a great transition because I needed the basics and then I was able to jump into the deep end of the language.

9. What are some of the big changes PHP has gone through in the past few years?
  - PHP now has realized Object Oriented Programming.

10. How do you concatenate numbers vs strings in PHP?
  - You use the + to concatenate numbers and . to concatenate strings.
